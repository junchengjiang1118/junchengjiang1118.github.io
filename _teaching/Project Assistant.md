This project focuses on how individual income tax supports flexible employment in gig economy and we build models
to optimize the Income Tax System.
* I undertook the task of cleaning CFPS data with Stata and drew relevant data graphs of basic situations like income
distribution and working hours per week to identify and summarize the characteristics of flexible employment
and formal employment groups
* I also collated literature on Income Shifting and learned the basic optimal tax theory.
