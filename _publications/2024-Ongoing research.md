The Optimal VAT(value-added-tax) System Design (the idea subject)
∗ Ideally, value-added tax is neutral, but in reality, many small companies do not have the qualifications to issue
invoices, which can make taxation non neutral in this production network.
∗ The model will be designed to address the issue of tax distortion between upstream and downstream enterprises
in a vertical industrial structure, especially in monopolistic markets
