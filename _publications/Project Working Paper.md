The subject is mainly based on the reform of digital public fiscal transformation in China.  The paper uses the empirical tool of Staggered DID to identify the reform effect on government budget management like the changes in the proportion of livelihood expenditures to total fiscal expenditures. Currently, the fiscal data is based on provincial governments and we are still collecting the city-level data from 2016-2024 which
is very laborious.
