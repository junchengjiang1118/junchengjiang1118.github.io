This talk is about class reading sharing. I reviewed the book of ___Profit for Profit: Fiscal Relations and Local Government Behavior___(**《以利为利：财政关系与地方政府行为》**) wirtten by Professor Feizhou Zhou who is in Peking University.<br> <br>The book gives the introduction about fiscal relations between center government and local government from 1949 to now in different systems. Additionally, the author also talked about  the government behavior and explain them in specific system and era by giving some examples and research results. <br><br>
In my talk, I firstly gave the breif review about the arrangement of whole book and selected some significant parts to present detailedly. Then I mainly introduced the Tax Sharing System Reform implemented in China in 1994. In addition to the content in the book, I downloaded and played the part of an interview memoir video with the then Minister of Finance as supplement. After that, I also shared the literture published on journals to reflect the views in academia.<br><br>
