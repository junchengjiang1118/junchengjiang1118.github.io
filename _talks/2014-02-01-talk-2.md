This talk  occurred in the undergraduate Public Finance class, the teacher asked us to selcet one topic about public goods or services to talk. I chose the education in Chinese System especially in compulsory education stage to present.<br><br>
In the class, I first talked about definition of Public Education Service and reviewed the literature. Then, I have conducted relevant analysis based on the teaching system in China. In the end, I gave some personal opinions on whether the government should turn education into a purely public good.
