I'm a sophomore from [School of Public Finance and Taxation](https://csxy.zuel.edu.cn/), [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](https://english.zuel.edu.cn/) and I will obtain my Bachelor's degree in May 2026. 

My research interest includes public economics on optimal taxation, fiscal policy, public debt, etc. In addition, other fields like labour economics and econometrics are also being explored.

I am willing to engage in economic research as a job for a lifetime in the future.This requires me to study further at a prestigious university as a doctoral student to qualify myself for it. Thus, applying for a doctoral program is my short-term goal currently. (Actually, a great masterâ€™s program is also acceptable.)
