I'm a junior(3rd year) student from [School of Public Finance and Taxation](https://csxy.zuel.edu.cn/), [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](https://english.zuel.edu.cn/) and I will obtain my Bachelor's degree in May 2026. 

My research interests include **public economics** on optimal taxation, fiscal policy and **labour economics** on education for human capital, income distribution. In addition, other fields like _development economics_ and _industrial economics_ are also being explored. I am willing to explore these fields in both theoretical and empirical ways.

I am willing to engage in economic research as a job for a lifetime in the future.This requires me to study further at a prestigious university as a doctoral student to qualify myself for it. Thus, applying for a doctoral program is my short-term goal currently. (Actually, a great Master/MPhil is also acceptable and I am very willing to apply for the **Research assistant** position or **Pre-doctoral** program before enrolling in a top Ph.D. program.)
