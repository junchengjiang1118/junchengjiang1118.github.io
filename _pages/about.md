I'm a spohomore undergraduate student from [School of Public Finance and Taxation](https://csxy.zuel.edu.cn/), [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](https://english.zuel.edu.cn/) and I will obtain my Bachelor's degree in May 2026. My research interest includes public and fiscal economics, optimal taxation, educational economics and econometrics.

 I am willing to engage in economic research as a job for a lifetime in the future.This requires me to further my studies at a prestigious university as a doctoral student to qualify it. So, applying for a doctoral program is my short-term goal currently.
