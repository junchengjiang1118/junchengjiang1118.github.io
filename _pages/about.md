My name is **Juncheng Jiang** (Pronounced approximately _June-chung Jee-ahng_) and I'm a senior year student from [School of Public Finance and Taxation](https://csxy.zuel.edu.cn/), [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](https://english.zuel.edu.cn/). I will obtain my Bachelor's degree in **May 2026**. 

My research interests include **public economics** on optimal taxation, fiscal policy and **labour economics** on education for human capital, income distribution. In addition, other fields like _**development economics**_ and _**industrial economics**_ are also being explored. I am willing to explore these fields in **both theoretical and empirical ways**.  <br> Here is the detailed [Research Interests Statement](../assets/Research Interests Statement__Juncheng Jiang.pdf).

I am willing to engage in economic research as a job for a lifetime in the future.This requires me to study further at a prestigious university as a doctoral student to qualify myself for it. Thus, **applying for a doctoral program** is my short-term goal currently. (Actually, a great Master/MPhil is also acceptable and I am very willing to apply for the **Research assistant** position or **Pre-doctoral** program before enrolling in **a top Ph.D. program**.)
